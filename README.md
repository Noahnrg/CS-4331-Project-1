### About
Soccer is the world's most popular sport, and the England league is the most popular league in the world. Put the two together, and you have a rich history of great clubs, and interesting visualitics of the rise and fall of the most famous clubs around the world.
To highlight these aspects, this project showcases 12 teams, across 4 divisions, from the 1949-50 season, until the most recent one, the 2017-18 season. 

### Data Processing: 
I pulled my data from [Here](http://www.myfootballfacts.com/FOOTBALL_LEAGUE_POSITIONS_CHRONOLOGICAL_1888-89_to_2009-10.html), taking 12 of the teams, from 4 divisions and data from the 1949-50 season until the 2017-18 season. From a CSV file, I imported it directly into my data.js file as an array, then did some formatting so it could be successfully processed by my other files and functions.


### Interesting Findings:

I never understood it visually, until I selected the "Big 6" teams, and set the years to last season, since 2000. What was fascinating was that There is an obvious reason why they are favorites, as they have stayed in the top league since the millennium
